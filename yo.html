<p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
<p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>

<p>Mister Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. Holy Jesus. What are these goddamn animals? Mister Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out. We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us. Giddy-up... no, no this way... good horsey. Bruce... I'm God. Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. The man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. Bruce... I'm God.</p>
<p>Boxing is about respect. Getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. We're not sheep! Me? I'm dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid. You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. It only took me six days. Same time it took the Lord to make the world. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. What? No. We can't stop here. This is bat country. Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. Well, what is it today? More spelunking? Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.</p>
<p>Bruce... I'm God. I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. Do you like my meadow? Try some of my grass! Please have a blade, please do, it's so delectable and so darn good looking! You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. It only took me six days. Same time it took the Lord to make the world. I now issue a new commandment: Thou shalt do the dance. Rehabilitated? Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means. A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip. I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...

<p>Holy Jesus. What are these goddamn animals? No, this is Mount Everest. You should flip on the Discovery Channel from time to time. But I guess you can't now, being dead and all. Boxing is about respect. Getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. Me? I'm dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid. I now issue a new commandment: Thou shalt do the dance. What? No. We can't stop here. This is bat country. Cities fall but they are rebuilt. Heroes die but they are remembered. Multiply your anger by about a hundred, Kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.

<p>I once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. Only perfect intentions. Cities fall but they are rebuilt. Heroes die but they are remembered. Boxing is about respect.

<p>We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us. Forget about it" is, like, if you agree with someone, you know, like "Raquel Welch is one great piece of ass. Forget about it!" But then, if you disagree, like "A Lincoln is better than a Cadillac? Forget about it!" You know? But then, it's also like if something's the greatest thing in the world, like, "Minghia! Those peppers! Forget about it!" A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip.
