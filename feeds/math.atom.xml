&lt;p&gt;Sheldon: "The best number is $73$. Why? 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying 7 and 3... and in binary 73 is a palindrome, 1001001, which backwards is 1001001."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$73_{10}=1001001_2$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leonard: "73 is the Chuck NorrisChuck Norris of numbers!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheldon: "Chuck Norris wishes... all Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-three is the 21st prime number. The previous is seventy-one, with which it comprises the 8th twin prime. It is also a permutable prime with thirty-seven. 73 is a star number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73 is the largest minimal Primitive root in the first 100,000 primes. In other words, if p is one of the first 100,000 primes, then at least one of the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ..., 73 is a primitive root modulo p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73 is the smallest prime congruent to 1 modulo 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73 is an emirp, meaning that the reverse of 73, that is, 37, is also a prime number. 73 is also the 21st prime number while 37 is the 12th prime number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number 21 has prime factors 7 and 3. The number 21 in binary is 10101; 7 in binary is 111, 3 in binary is 11, and seventy-three in binary is 1001001. All of these are palindromes. In addition, of the 7 binary digits representing 73, there are 3 ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$37 + 12 = 49 (7^2) \:\:and,$$
$$73 + 21 = 94 = 47 \cdot 2, \:\:\:47 + 2 = 7^2$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, both 73 and its mirror, 37, are sexy primes twice over, as 31, 43, 67 and 79 are all prime numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every positive integer can be written as the sum of 73 or fewer sixth powers (see Waring's problem).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In base 5, the smallest prime with a composite sum of digits is 73.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73 is the only prime repunit in base 8 (1118).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;73 is the smallest factor of the first composite generalized Fermat number in base 10 $ 10 ^ 4 + 1 = 10001 = 73\cdot137$ .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
