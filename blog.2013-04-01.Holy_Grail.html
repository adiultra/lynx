<p><em>Posted at 2013-04-01.</em></p>
<p>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives
beyond these woods. A newt? Did you dress her up like this? On second thoughts,
let's not go there. It is a silly place. You don't vote for kings. Knights of
Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these
woods.</p>
<h3>Bridgekeeper</h3>
<p>Camelot! What do you mean? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Ah, now
we see the violence inherent in the system!</p>
<p>You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a
silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your
silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! I don't want to talk to you no more, you
empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your
mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I
am forced to taunt you a second time! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your
new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Now, look here, my good man.</p>
<h3>What a strange</h3>
<p>She looks like one. Why do you think that she is a witch? Look, my liege! Bring
her forward!</p>
