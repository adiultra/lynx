<p>Boxing is about respect. Getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. No, this is Mount Everest. You should flip on the Discovery Channel from time to time. But I guess you can't now, being dead and all. I now issue a new commandment: Thou shalt do the dance. I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd. Mister Wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when I'm asked, I don't have to lie. But don't think of me as an idiot. Bruce... I'm God. I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, BASE-jumping crowd. Circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. I did the same thing to Gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. Well, what is it today? More spelunking?</p>

<p>It only took me six days. Same time it took the Lord to make the world. Bruce... I'm God. Bruce... I'm God. You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. Rehabilitated? Well, now let me see. You know, I don't have any idea what that means. I once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. Only perfect intentions.
